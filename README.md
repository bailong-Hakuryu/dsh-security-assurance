# DSH Security Assurance

DSH Security Assurance is an independent DeepSeek Harness plugin for
evidence-backed application-security assessment. It integrates through public
Harness and Cordis seams and does not modify Harness Core.

## Current implementation status

This repository is at the first vertical implementation slice, not at the
`0.1.0-rc.1` release candidate. The current private development package proves:

- dormant bundle installation metadata;
- real Cordis registration at `ctx.securityAssurance`;
- an opaque, runtime-verified Security Invocation boundary;
- the authorized `getHealth` operation;
- versioned Zod-validated public contracts;
- one `SecurityResult<T>` success/failure envelope;
- redacted authorization, validation, cancellation, deadline, and internal
  failures; and
- Fiber-owned Service disposal.

Repository registration, Assessment execution, analyzers, Evidence persistence,
Control Plane integration, tools, and Workbench are deliberately not claimed as
implemented yet.

## Development

Requirements:

- Node `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`
- pnpm
- the qualified read-only Harness reference at
  `D:\Deepseek\deepseek-harness-master` for local Cordis development linking

Commands:

```text
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm pack:dry-run
pnpm pack:smoke
```

The bundle row in `cordis.patch.yml` is disabled by default. Installation alone
does not activate a security authority.

## Design authority

- `CONTEXT.md` defines the domain language.
- `docs/adr/` contains the accepted decisions.
- `docs/implementation-specification.md` maps those decisions to implementation
  phases and acceptance evidence.
- `docs/deepseek-harness-plugin-surface-study.md` records the read-only Harness
  source facts used by the design.

Conformance proves that the product behaves according to its contract. It does
not by itself prove that the product finds real vulnerabilities effectively;
Security Effectiveness has a separate preregistered evaluation track.
